## Parameter-induced drift (reproducible demonstration)

This repository includes a minimal script demonstrating parameter-induced drift.

Run:

    parameter_induced_drift.py

The script generates an irreversible process with time-varying coupling κ(t),
fits mis-specified exponential models over increasing observation windows,
and shows systematic drift of the fitted decay rate λ̂(T).

This illustrates structural bias in rate-based descriptions of irreversible
processes, as discussed in Section IX of the paper.
